## Customization & AI Synchronization

Most of the personal information is centralized in the data/ and config/ directories for easy updates. The AI Assistant's knowledge is automatically synchronized with these data files.

### Personal Info
Update data/general.ts with your name, role, socials, and hobbies. This will update the site UI and the AI's persona.

### Projects & Experience
- Edit data/projects.ts to showcase your work.
- Edit data/experience.ts to list your professional history.
- Edit data/skills.ts to highlight your technical expertise.
- Update data/blog.ts with your latest posts.

Any changes made here will be instantly reflected in the AI's responses through the generateAnkurPersonaPrompt utility.

### Site Configuration
Update config/siteConfig.ts for SEO metadata, URL, and OpenGraph settings.

### AI Persona
Modify lib/prompts.ts to customize how your AI assistant behaves and what information it knows about you.
